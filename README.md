- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dave-314
- 👀 I’m interested in using github to put together a Data Analyst Portfolio.
- 🌱 I began learning python with focus on it's machine learning packages and to better learn how to manipulate, vizualize, and learn from data. I am lso familiar with         some R, SAS, and SQL but this will focus with Python on Jupyter notebook.
- 💞️ Feel free to contact me regarding my projects/code, constructive criticism is a great way to make progress. What would you have done differently?
